## Instructions
You start each level with various slimes. To beat the level a certain number of tiles have to be filled by each slime as directed.
Choose which slime to place from the selection at the bottom and click on the grid to place it. When you are ready you can start the slime's growth by clicking the start button to the right of the selection panel. (Slime can be placed after you click start as well.)
The slimes will spread out according to their growth conditions. The objective is to get a specific minimum of every slime available to you before the time runs out, shown on the display on the left.
